    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is about as easy as it gets for a cookie recipe. Rip open a box of cake mix, plop in two eggs and a little oil, and voila! Great cookies!</p>
    <p>I made mine too big, so by the time they cooked on top, the bottoms were pretty well done. Just follow the recipe and make "little balls" and you'll be good to go!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Package of Cake Mix</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF (175ºC)</li>
        <li>Stir cake mix, oil, and eggs together in a largowl until it becomes a dough</li>
        <li>Form dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, about 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how soft you like your cookies. 
            Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
